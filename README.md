# Choose your own adventure

Exemple of an exercise writen in Go i wrote months ago and recently cleaned up in order to "host" it on my github. It is called Choose your own adventure and it is based on data i've found on [calhoun.io](https://courses.calhoun.io)

## Go

## Dockerfile and k8s manifest

Recently I was _POCing_ solutions for hosting kubernetes clusters on my local computer (such as kind, k3s, minikube, ...) and I thought it would be nice to use web apps so I've created a Docker image for this app. This is why you can fin a Dockerfile and a k8s manifest.
